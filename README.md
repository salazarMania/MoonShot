Hello Everyone, 
I have created an app called MoonShot under the guidance of Paul Hudson. This app shows the Apollo missions and its details with the astronauts involved and their role in the mission. It also includes the details of the astronauts. Its a fun app that teaches us a lot about the space exploration programs.
This app is targeted for both kids and adults alike. 
Have fun learning about space!
